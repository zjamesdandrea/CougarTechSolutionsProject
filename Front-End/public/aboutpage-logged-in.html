            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Trako Saluskin, and I am the owner and founder of ICKY Buffalo Breaks. I have been a lifelong sports fan<br>
            Ever since I was a kid, I have been watching baseball, attending games, and collecting baseball cards. My favorite baseball team is <br>
            the Yankees and one my favorite players is Jackie Robinson. Through this website, I am looking to build a community that is centered around <br>
            discussion of all things baseball and the trading of baseball cards. Please take sometime to explore my current inventory and submit an interest form<br>
            if there are any cards you are interested in. I am fairly flexible on the prices. Plase join me on Facebook and Instragram for uodates on <br>
            new additions to the inventory.</p>
